### FAQ

This is a preliminary answer to some of the most common questions I see on most people's mod pages.

#### NeoForge/Fabric ports when?

- Fabric: Not planned yet.
- NeoForge: No. I'm only works in Forge.

##### Why you are not planned to NeoForge ports?

Because I don't exactly know what happened to Forge development team.   
I didn't understand the full story of that incident because I was doing other things while it was happening.   
So I just do my business as usual.

#### x.y.z version update/ports when?

Please wait. I'm not development much that actively.   
But let me say this one thing for sure: I will not port this for previous versions.

#### Is this mod dead? Why not updated? / Releases when?

Please wait a while. Since this is a one-person development, the update speed may be slow.

#### XXX has YYY bug! Please fix it!

Before reporting in the Issues tab, please check if the bug you are experiencing has already been reported.   
Please attach log files and crash log files (if a crash occurred) to help us fix bugs or errors.   
When attaching additional materials, it is recommended to attach intuitive materials such as photos and videos if possible.   
(The easiest and most reliable way is to record a scene that reproduces the error symptoms directly as a video.)

##### Why hasn't this bug been fixed yet?

Because it's too high level for me to fix it. If it causes significant damage that interferes with gameplay, please report it in the Issues tab.   
Then, after confirmation, I will upload a patch version that temporarily removes it until it can be resolved.
