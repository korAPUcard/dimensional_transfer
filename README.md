# Easy Item Transfer
### Minecraft Mod Project #11

**Mod Version**: 1.0.0-exp *(Not a alpha version.)*   
**Experimental Build Description**: This is a test build that is earlier than the Alpha version and is very likely not to be released for stability reasons due to incomplete source code.

**Author**: APUcard

**Team scale**: Single 
AI assistant based. No need other peoples help for this project.

### Description
This adds a special chest to your game, but fundamentally it works differently than the ender chest.   
It only adds a new tile entity block, without modifying the vanilla source code (Ender Chest or related code).

This can eliminate the need to go through the hassle of using the NBT editor to transfer items to other worlds.

### NOTE

**Not released yet. It's still in development.**
